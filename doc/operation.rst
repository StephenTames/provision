Digital Rebar Provision Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section will attempt to describe common operations and actions that can be done.  We will assume that 
drpcli is already somewhere in the path and have setup the environment variables to access Digital Rebar Provision.  See, :ref:`rs_cli`.

Some of these operations are in the :ref:`rs_ui`, but not all.  This will focus on CLI usage for now.  See the :ref:`rs_ui`
section for UI usage.

.. note:: **drpcli** normally spits out JSON formatted objects or an array of objects.  To help with some of the command line functions, we use the **jq** tool.  This is available for both Linux and Darwin.


Preference Setting
++++++++++++++++++

Usually, it is necessary to get or set the preferences for the system.

  ::

    # Show the current preference settings
    drpcli prefs list

    # Or get a specific one
    drpcli prefs get unknownBootEnv


Set a preference

  ::

    # Set a preference
    drpcli prefs set unknownBootEnv discovery

    # or chain multiples as pairs
    drpcli prefs set unknownBootEnv discovery defaultBootEnv sledgehammer

The system does validate values to make sure they are sane, so watch for errors.


BootEnv Operations
++++++++++++++++++


Installing a "Canned" BootEnv
-----------------------------

Manipulating :ref:`rs_model_bootenv` and :ref:`rs_model_template` are handled by their own commands.  There are some
additional helpers especially when following the layout of the initial :ref:`rs_install`.

To install a provided :ref:`rs_model_bootenv`, do the following from the install location.

  ::

    cd assets
    drpcli bootenvs install bootenvs/ubuntu-16.04.yml

This is a CLI helper that is not in the API that will read the provided YAML :ref:`rs_model_bootenv` file,
upload the included or referenced :ref:`rs_model_template` files (from the *templates* peer directory), upload
the :ref:`rs_model_bootenv`, and check for an existing ISO in the ISO repository.  If an ISO is not present in
the already uploaded list, it will check a local isos directory for the file.  If that is not present and the
:ref:`rs_model_bootenv` contains a URL for the ISO, the ISO will attempt to be downloaded to the local isos
directory and then uploaded into Digital Rebar Provision.  Once upload, the ISO is "exploded" for access by
machines in the file server file system space.


Cloning a BootEnv
-----------------

Sometimes there is a :ref:`rs_model_bootenv` but it is necessary to make changes.  These can be handled by :ref:`rs_model_template`
inclusion, but for now let's just focus on basic "cut and paste" style editing.

  ::

    drpcli bootenvs show ubuntu-16.04-install --format yaml > new-file.yaml
    # Edit the file
    #  change the Name field to something new. *MUST DO THIS*
    #  change the OS->Name field to something new to avoid sharing an iso directory.
    #  Edit other parameters as needed
    drpcli bootenvs create - < new-file.yaml

This is a shallow clone.  It will reuse the templates unless they are explicitly modified.  It is possible to use the *install*
command, but any new templates would need to be added to a *templates* directory in the current directory.

Creating a BootEnv
------------------

It might be necessary to create an empty :ref:`rs_model_bootenv` by doing the following:

  ::

    drpcli bootenvs create emtpy_bootenv

This :ref:`rs_model_bootenv` will not be *Available*, but will allow for additional editing.

Editing a BootEnv
-----------------

It might be necessary to edit a :ref:`rs_model_bootenv`.  To do this, get the latest copy with the *show*
command.  Edit the file as needed.  Then using the *update* command, put the value back.  The *--format=yaml*
is optional, but I find YAML easier to edit.

  ::

    drpcli bootenvs show discovery --format=yaml > discovery.yaml
    # Edit the discovery.yaml as needed
    drpcli bootenvs update discovery - < discovery.yaml

Template Operations
+++++++++++++++++++

Cloning a Template
------------------

It might be necessary to create a new template from an existing one.  To do this, do the following:

  ::

    drpcli templates show net_seed.tmpl | jq -r .Contents > new.tmpl
    # Edit the new.tmpl to be what is required
    drpcli templates upload new.tmpl as new_template

In this case, we are using **jq** to help us out.  **jq** is a JSON processing command line filter.  JSON can be used to retrieve the required data.  In this case, we are wanting the Contents of the template.  We save that to file, edit it, and upload it as a
new template, *new_template*.

It is possible to use the **create** subcommand of template, but often times **upload** is easier.

.. note:: Remember to add the new template to a :ref:`rs_model_bootenv` or another :ref:`rs_model_template` as an embedded template.


Updating a Template
-------------------

It might be necessary to edit an existing template.  To do this, do the following:

  ::

    drpcli templates show net_seed.tmpl | jq -r .Contents > edit.tmpl
    # Edit the edit.tmpl to be what is desired
    drpcli templates upload edit.tmpl as net_seed.tmpl

We use **jq** to get a copy of the current template, edit it, and use the upload command to replace the template.
If there already is a template present, then it can be replaced with the upload command.

Profile Operations
++++++++++++++++++

Creating a Profile
------------------

It might be necessary to create a :ref:`rs_model_profile`.  An empty profile can be created by doing the following:

  ::

    drpcli profiles create '{ "Name": "myprofile" }'

    or

    drpcli profiles create myprofile

The system will attempt to use any sent string as the Name of the profile.

Additionally, JSON can be provided to fill in some default values.

  ::

    drpcli profiles create '{ "Name": "myprofile", "Params": { "string_param1": "string", "map_parm1": { "key1": "value", "key2": "value2" } } }'


Deleting a Profile
------------------

It might be necessary to delete a :ref:`rs_model_profile`.  It is possible to use the destroy command in the profile CLI,
but the :ref:`rs_model_profile` must not be in use.  Use the following:

  ::

    drpcli profiles destroy myprofile


Altering an Existing Profile (including global)
-----------------------------------------------

It might be necessary to update an existing :ref:`rs_model_profile`, including **global**.  parameter values can be *set* by doing the following:

  ::

    drpcli profiles set myprofile param crazycat to true
    # These last two will show the value or the whole profile.
    drpcli profiles get myprofile param crazycat
    drpcli profiles show myprofile

.. note:: Setting a parameter's value to **null** will clear it from the structure.

Alternatively, the update command can be used to send raw JSON similar to create.

  ::

    drpcli profiles update myprofile '{ "Params": { "string_param1": "string", "map_parm1": { "key1": "value", "key2": "value2" }, "crazycat": null } }'

Update is an additive operation by default.  So, to remove items, **null** must be passed as
the value of the key to be removed.

Machine Operations
++++++++++++++++++

Creating a Machine
------------------

It might be necessary to create a :ref:`rs_model_machine`.  Given the IP that the machine will boot as all that is required is to 
create the machine and assign a :ref:`rs_model_bootenv`.  To do this, do the following:

  ::

    drpcli machine create '{ "Name": "greg.rackn.com", "Address": "1.1.1.1" }'

This would create the :ref:`rs_model_machine` named *greg.rackn.com* with an expected IP Address of *1.1.1.1*.  *dr-provision*
will create the machine, create a UUID for the node, and assign the :ref:`rs_model_bootenv` based upon the *defaultBootEnv*
:ref:`rs_model_prefs`.

  ::

    drpcli machine create '{ "Name": "greg.rackn.com", "Address": "1.1.1.1", "BootEnv": "ubuntu-16.04-install" }'

This would do the same thing as above, but would create the :ref:`rs_model_machine` with the *ubuntu-16.04-install*
:ref:`rs_model_bootenv`.

.. note:: The :ref:`rs_model_bootenv` MUST exist or the create will fail.

To create an empty :ref:`rs_model_machine`, do the following:

  ::

    drpcli machine create jill.rackn.com

This will create an empty :ref:`rs_model_machine` named *jill.rackn.com*.

.. note:: The *defaultBootEnv* :ref:`rs_model_bootenv` MUST exist or the create will fail.


Adding or Removing a Profile to a Machine
-----------------------------------------

It might be necessary to add or remove a :ref:`rs_model_profile` to or from a :ref:`rs_model_machine`.  To add a profile, do the following:

  ::

    drpcli machines addprofile "dff3a693-76a7-49ce-baaa-773cbb6d5092" myprofile


To remove a profile, do the following:

  ::

    drpcli machines removeprofile "dff3a693-76a7-49ce-baaa-773cbb6d5092" myprofile

The :ref:`rs_model_machine` update command can also be used to modify the list of :ref:`rs_model_profile`.


Changing BootEnv on a Machine
-----------------------------

It might be necessary to change the :ref:`rs_model_bootenv` associated with a :ref:`rs_model_machine`.  To do this, do the following:

  ::

    drpcli machines bootenv drpcli "dff3a693-76a7-49ce-baaa-773cbb6d5092" mybootenv

.. note:: The :ref:`rs_model_bootenv` *MUST* exists or the command will fail.


DHCP Operations
+++++++++++++++

Creating a Reservation
----------------------

It might be necessary to create a :ref:`rs_model_reservation`.  This would be to make sure that a specific MAC Address received
a specific IP Address.  Here is an example command.

  ::

     drpcli reservations create '{ "Addr": "1.1.1.1", "Token": "08:00:27:33:77:de", "Strategy": "MAC" }'

Additionally, it is possible to add DHCP options or the Next Boot server.

  ::

     drpcli reservations create '{ "Addr": "1.1.1.5", "Token": "08:01:27:33:77:de", "Strategy": "MAC", "NextServer": "1.1.1.2", "Options": [ { "Code": 44, "Value": "1.1.1.1" } ] }'

Remember to add an option 1 (netmask) if a subnet is not being used to fill the default options.

User Operations
+++++++++++++++

Creating a User
---------------

It might be necessary to create a :ref:`rs_model_user`.  By default, the user will be created without
a valid password.  The user will only be able to access the system through granted tokens.

To create a user, do the following:

  ::

    drpcli users create fred

.. note:: This :ref:`rs_model_user` will *NOT* be able to access the system without additional admin action.


Granting a User Token
---------------------

Sometimes as an administrator, it may be necessary to grant a limited use and scope access token to a user.  To
grant a token, do the following:

  ::

    drpcli users token fred

This will create a token that is valid for 1 hour and can do anything.  Additionally, the CLI can take
additional parameters that alter the token's scope (model), actions, and key.

  ::

    drpcli users token fred ttl 600 scope users action password specific fred

This will create a token that is valid for 10 minutes and can only execute the password API call on the
:ref:`rs_model_user` object named *fred*.

To use the token in with the CLI, use the -T option.

  ::

    drpcli -T <token> bootenvs list


Deleting a User
---------------

It might be necessary to remove a reset from the system.  To remove a user, do the following:

  ::

    drpcli users destroy fred


Revoking a User's Password
--------------------------

To clear the password from a :ref:`rs_model_user`, do the following:

  ::

    drpcli users update fred '{ "PasswordHash": "12" }'

This basically creates an invalid hash which matches no passwords.  Issued tokens will still continue to
function until their times expire.

Secure User Creation Pattern
----------------------------

A secure pattern would be the following:

* Admin creates a new account

  ::

    drpcli users create fred

* Admin creates a token for that account that only can set the password and sends that token to new user.

  ::

    drpcli users token fred scope users action password ttl 3600

* New user uses token to set their password

  ::

    drpcli -T <token> users password fred mypassword
